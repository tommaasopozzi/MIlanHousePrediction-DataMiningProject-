# House Price Prediction in Milan Using Data Mining Techniques

This project applies data mining techniques to predict house prices in the metropolitan city of Milan.  
The dataset (â‰ˆ 8,000 observations, 16 variables), contains property features such as size, number of rooms and bathrooms, floor, heating system, energy efficiency, and additional amenities.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Target variable**: `Selling Price` (house price in â‚¬).  
- **Main predictors**:
  - Square meters, number of rooms, number of bathrooms  
  - Floor and total floors in the building  
  - Lift availability  
  - Condition (excellent, good, new, to be refurbished)  
  - Heating system (centralized vs. independent)  
  - Energy efficiency class  
  - Parking availability  
  - Location (zone in Milan)  
  - Additional features (terrace, garden, concierge, swimming pool, etc.)  

Extensive **data preprocessing** was required:  
- Handling â‰ˆ 4,000 missing values with domain-driven imputation strategies  
- Feature engineering (e.g., luxury index, distance from Duomo, optional amenities)  
- Outlier detection and correction (e.g., unrealistic surface area or condominium fees)

## ðŸ”§ Methods
Several predictive models were tested:  
- Linear regression (with fixed and random effects for `zone`)  
- Linear models with B-splines  
- Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with thin plate regression splines  

Key methodological choices:  
- Logarithmic transformation of `Selling Price`  
- Shrinkage effects via mixed models (`zone` as a random intercept)  
- Exploration of non-linear relationships using splines  
- Interaction effects (e.g., bathrooms Ã— surface, floor Ã— luxury, Duomo distance Ã— luxury)

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- The **GAM with random intercepts for `zone`** achieved the best trade-off between interpretability and predictive accuracy.  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on validation set â‰ˆ **78,000 â‚¬**.  
- Non-linearities in `square meters` and `year of construction` were significant.  
- Luxury features (pool, alarm system, concierge) showed strong positive effects on price.  
- Location (`zone`) remained the most impactful predictor.
